# Exercise 4: Analyze Tasks with an AI Assistant

Instructions:

1. Pick a simple task from your work or personal life (something fairly small like drafting an email, outlining a presentation, or planning a meeting or event).
2. Start a conversation with Claude
3. With Claude, share the task you are thinking about doing. 
   1. E.g. "Hi Claude, I'm preparing how to [insert task] and want to discuss with you what a delegation plan may look like for figuring out which parts I should delegate to an AI like you vs. not. Can you help me with this?"
4. Together, explore these questions:
   1. What is the overall vision for the task? What does a good result look like? 
   2. What are the different bits of work needed to get there? 
   3. Which of these bits of work require human expertise, creativity, or judgment? 
   4. Note: When discussing these questions, have an actual conversation! Don't just make statements or list answers. Actually have a chat back and forthâ€”you each may see something the other doesn't!
5. Work together to create a simple delegation plan that uses both your strengths and the AI's strengths.
