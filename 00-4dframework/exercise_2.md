# Exercise 2: Explore something you love

Estimated time: 5-10 minutes

Spend 5-10 minutes chatting with Claude about a topic you're passionate about and know well. We will be using Claude across exercises for the rest of the course, but you can also do these exercises with another AI. In fact, it might be worthwhile for you to try the exercises across this course with several AI assistants to get a feel for how they differ.

## Instructions:

1. Choose a topic you know well and enjoy discussing such as a hobby, professional interest, favorite book series, etc.
2. Have a natural conversation with Claude about this topic, like you would with someone who shares your interest.
3. Try to notice moments where:
   1. Claude enhances your thinking 
   2. You need to clarify or correct the Claude's understanding 
   3. Your expertise leads you to evaluate the Claude's responses
