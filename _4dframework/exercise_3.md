# Exercise 3: Learn something new

Estimated time: 5-10 minutes

Spend 5-10 minutes asking Claude to teach you about a topic you're unfamiliar with but interested in exploring. See how this experience differs from your conversation about something you love and know well.

## Instructions:

1. Choose a topic you'd like to learn more about.
2. Engage Claude in a conversation to help you understand the basics of this topic. Don't worry about prompting the "wrong way" or the "right way." Just ask Claude to teach you.
3. Try to notice moments where the Claude:
   1. Offers helpful explanations 
   2. Provides examples that make abstract ideas concrete 
   3. Responds naturally to your questions as they arise 
   4. Explains things where you would want to double check its explanations
