# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
This is an educational project focused on AI collaboration methodology, teaching the **4D Framework** for effective AI interaction. It is NOT a traditional software development project.

## Environment Setup
- Python 3.11 virtual environment: `.venv/`
- IDE: JetBrains (PyCharm/IntelliJ) with project configuration in `.idea/`
- Formatter: Black (configured in `.idea/inclusively.iml`)

## Project Structure

## The 4D Framework
This project teaches four key principles for AI collaboration:
1. **Delegation** - Clear task and role definitions
2. **Description** - Detailed requirement conversations
3. **Discernment** - Critical evaluation of AI outputs  
4. **Diligence** - Ownership and responsibility

## Development Commands
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux

# No build, test, or lint scripts - this is a documentation-only project
```

## Working with This Repository
- This is primarily educational content, not a codebase requiring development
- Exercise files contain prompts and guidance for AI collaboration practice
- No external dependencies or complex build processes
- Focus on understanding and applying the 4D Framework concepts when assisting users
