## Exercise 1: Apply the 4Ds

**Creative project**

You're collaborating with AI to develop character concepts for a story.

- Delegation: What creative elements would you want to explore through AI collaboration vs. develop independently?
- Description: How might you guide the AI to generate characters that fit your story's world?
- Discernment: How would you decide which AI-suggested elements to keep, modify, or discard?
- Diligence: How would you acknowledge AI's contribution to your creative work?
