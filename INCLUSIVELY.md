.md file for ClaudeCode

# Overview
Inclusively's core purpose is to "unlock everyone's value". Our vision is to be the "authority on workplace
experience".

Our main product, Retain, is a technology platform that acts as the "GPS of Workforce Strategy".

Retain was built for a new era of work. It’s an opportunity to redesign how work happens—embedding systems that actually
support how people operate day to day. When done right, companies can build more responsive, data-driven environments
that flex with evolving employee needs. Retain serves as a signal engine that continuously collects meaningful insights
from your workforce and turns them into action, like the Google Maps of workforce transformation.

# Core Concepts

**Success Enabler**: This is a key term in our system. A Success Enabler is an essential tool, benefit, or support your
company provides—from accommodations, workplace flexibility, and holistic well-being & growth—designed to remove
everyday barriers and empower you to thrive, grow, and do your best work.

**The Inclusively Success Enabler Framework**: This is our dynamic intelligence engine that maps natural language inputs to
the most relevant resources across systems. It powers real-time, personalized recommendations for everything from
disability accommodations to general benefits.

**The Problem**: Today’s HR infrastructure is fragmented, with investments in a wide range of benefits, accommodations, and
resources managed in silos. Employees often don't know what they need, aren't sure what's available, and can't find it
easily. This leads to wasted investments, with 33% of HR investments going unutilized.

**Our Solution**: The Retain platform ingests, maps, and organizes all of a company's resources into the Inclusively
Framework. This approach ensures employees have access to all resources and provides employers with actionable data on
resource utilization and gaps.

# Target Audience

Our primary buyer personas are leaders in HR and talent management:
Benefits Teams: Focused on increasing utilization of existing benefits and maximizing ROI.

**Accessibility Teams**: Focused on ensuring equitable access to resources and creating an inclusive workplace experience.

**Talent Acquisition (TA) Teams**: Focused on attracting and retaining top talent/

**Secondary Audience**: Broader leadership roles like Chief People Officers, who view employee support as a critical
component of workforce planning.

# Company Goals

**10-Year Target**: Work with 85% of the Fortune 500 and impact over 10 million employees17.

**3-Year Picture (by Dec 31, 2027)**: Achieve $15mn in revenue, reach break-even profitability, and impact over 1 million
people18. We also aim to be the "authority on workplace experience".

**1-Year Plan (by Dec 31, 2025)**: Generate $2mn in Retain ARR, establish a repeatable sales motion, and have a defined path
to break-even.

**Quarterly Rocks (Q3 2025)**: Hit $1mn in Retain ARR, launch the new admin experience, and make progress on key
integrations with Microsoft and ServiceNow.

**Key Initiative**: A primary goal is to integrate with existing employee systems, such as Microsoft Teams and ServiceNow,
to increase our platform's exposure and collect more data. By aggregating this data, we provide analytics and "Employee
signals" to HR admins, giving them insights into the pulse of the organization.

# Engineering & Product Principles

**Accessibility Firs**t: We prioritize accessibility by adhering to WCAG 2.2 AA conformance. We incorporate Deque from Axe
testing into our development lifecycle and prioritize accessibility features over other enhancements.
Data Privacy and Anonymity: Maintaining employee anonymity is a core principle. We do not share user IDs with employers,
allowing employees to safely discover their Success Enablers without fear of judgment.

**Integration and Modularity**: Our goal is to connect a company's existing fragmented systems and create a more intuitive
way for employees to access resources24. We are an integrated solution, not just "another platform to sign in to".

**AI-Driven Personalization**: We use GenAI to capture anonymous inputs and deliver cross-system recommendations. Our
dynamic intelligence engine maps natural language inputs to the most relevant resources across systems.
