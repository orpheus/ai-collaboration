# Execution Brief for teams_integration_implementation

**!!!!!IMPORTANT!!!!!**
This is a demo application / execution brief. The codebase does not exist yet.
For demo purposes, just create a minimal demo application with teams integration
without needing to be hooked up to Retain APIs. Mock all APIs/authentication.
Build the bare minimum react app needed to mock the use case. Use no external dependencies,
only bare react, css, and web builders. Ignore anything that is not feasible for the purposes
of building a mock prototype and call them out.
