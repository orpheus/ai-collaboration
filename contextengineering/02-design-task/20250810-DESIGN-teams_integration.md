# Design: Microsoft Teams Tab App Integration for Retain

## Problem Statement
Retain needs Teams integration to remove adoption barriers for enterprise employees who live in Teams daily, enabling anonymous discovery of Success Enablers (tools, benefits, accommodations) while providing HR leaders with engagement analytics.

## Solution Approach
Implement a Teams Tab App using iframe approach initially, with Teams SSO for seamless authentication, maintaining user anonymity in analytics while providing personalized, employer-specific content.

## Unknowns Requiring Investigation
- Specific Teams manifest requirements for enterprise deployment
- Performance implications of iframe vs native approach at scale
- Teams App certification requirements for enterprise stores
- Handling of deep links from Teams notifications/messages
- Multi-tenant architecture needs (multiple enterprise customers)

## Proposed Task Structure

### Subtasks

1. **Teams App Infrastructure Setup**
   - Create Teams app manifest and configuration
   - Set up Azure AD app registration for SSO
   - Implement Teams SDK integration in frontend

2. **Authentication & Session Management**
   - Build Teams SSO token validation endpoint
   - Create user mapping service (Teams ID â†’ Retain user)
   - Implement session management for Teams context

3. **Teams-Optimized Frontend Route**
   - Create `/teams` route with simplified navigation
   - Optimize UI for Teams tab constraints (responsive, theme-aware)
   - Handle Teams SDK context and theme changes

4. **Backend API Adaptations**
   - Extend existing APIs to handle Teams authentication tokens
   - Ensure employer-specific data filtering based on Teams context
   - Maintain anonymity in analytics layer

5. **Search & Discovery Features**
   - Implement Success Enabler search within tab
   - Create card-based browsing interface
   - Optional: Add Teams search message extension for global search

### Task Requirements

**Teams App Infrastructure:**
- Must support both personal and channel tabs
- Include proper scopes for SSO and Graph API access
- Support Teams desktop, web, and mobile clients

**Authentication & Session:**
- Zero additional login steps for users
- Maintain existing Retain permission model
- Handle token refresh transparently

**Frontend Route:**
- Load time under 3 seconds in Teams context
- Support Teams dark/light/high-contrast themes
- Mobile-responsive for Teams mobile app

**Backend API:**
- Validate Teams tokens against Microsoft Graph
- Return only employer-authorized Success Enablers
- Preserve anonymous aggregation for HR analytics

**Search & Discovery:**
- Search response time under 1 second
- Support filtering/categorization of Success Enablers
- Include click tracking for engagement metrics

## Technical Architecture Notes

### Authentication Flow
```
1. User opens Retain tab in Teams
2. Teams SDK: microsoftTeams.authentication.getAuthToken()
3. Send token to Retain backend: /api/teams/auth
4. Backend validates with Microsoft Graph
5. Create/retrieve Retain session
6. Return employer-specific content
```

### Privacy & Anonymity Preservation
- Teams provides user identity for content authorization
- Backend maintains separate anonymous session for analytics
- HR dashboard shows aggregated data without individual identification

## Technical Risks (Top Priority)

1. **Performance in iframe**: Monitor load times, consider lazy loading
   - Mitigation: Implement performance budgets and monitoring from day 1
   - Fallback: Native Teams app components if iframe performance degrades

2. **SSO complexity**: Build fallback auth flow for edge cases
   - Mitigation: Implement comprehensive error handling and retry logic
   - Fallback: Manual login flow with clear user guidance

3. **Multi-tenant isolation**: Ensure strict employer data boundaries
   - Mitigation: Automated testing of data isolation per deployment
   - Fallback: Separate deployment instances if shared architecture fails

## Additional Recommendations

### Phase 1 (MVP - 2-3 weeks)
- Basic tab app with iframe approach
- SSO authentication
- Core search and browse functionality

### Phase 2 (Enhancement - 2-3 weeks)
- Adaptive Cards for richer interactions
- Message extensions for sharing
- Deep linking support

### Phase 3 (Optimization)
- Performance optimizations
- Native components where beneficial
- Advanced Teams features (notifications, bots)
